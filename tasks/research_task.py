        You must do only one thing:

        üîç Search for a STRICT_RESPONSE match to this ticket using the knowledge base.
        You can only use entries marked as `common_issue`.

        If a match is found:
        - Return only the STRICT_RESPONSE content exactly as it is (no editing).
        - Use this structure:

        STRICT_RESPONSE:

        If no STRICT_RESPONSE is found:
        - Return only: NO_MATCH
