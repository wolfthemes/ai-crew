    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Decibel theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 3.8.17  \n**Released:** 10 march 2015  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Decibel. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **decibel.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Decibel, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"decibel\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Decibel theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nDecibel includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Decibel, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=decibel).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=decibel).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Decibel automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Decibel is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nDecibel comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Decibel, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nDecibel offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Decibel blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Decibel.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Decibel: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Decibel, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Decibel using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nDecibel comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Decibel, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Decibel also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Decibel you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor.

Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Albums\n\nTo create an albums index page, you must have [Wolf Albums](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-albums/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your albums.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Albums\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Albums\" page at any time in the **\"Galleries\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\nThis page will be used by WordPress to display your gallery archives pages: the default gallery index page and the category gallery page.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your albums.\n\n##### Create a gallery for your album\n\nTo create an album, click on \"Galleries\" > \"Add new\".\n\nSet a title for your album, insert a WPBakery Page Builder gallery element in page builder mode, and set a featured image that will be used as album cover.\n\n## Playlist\n\nHere is a simple video that shows you how to create a playlist with Decibel.\n\n### Playlist in Row\n\nTo add a playlist at the bottom of a row, go in the row settings and navigate to the \"Sticky\" player tab.\n\nYou will be able to choose which playlist to display and the skin you want to use fro your player.\n\n![](assets/img/playlist-row.png)\n\n### Playlist Bar a the Bottom of the Page\n\nTo add a sticky player at the bottom of a row, simply use the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/sticky-playlist.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Decibel.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nDecibel comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Decibel customizer options.

Then go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Modal Window\"** panel and select which content block to display in your modal window.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Decibel.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Protheme theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 2.9.17  \n**Released:** 5th June 2017  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Protheme. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **protheme.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Protheme, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"protheme\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Protheme theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nProtheme includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Protheme, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=protheme).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=protheme).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Protheme automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Protheme is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nProtheme comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Protheme, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nProtheme offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Protheme blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Protheme.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Protheme: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Protheme, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Protheme using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Page templates\n\nIf you use [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wlfthm.es/wpbpb) plugin to create your pages, you will have a lot options to set your page layout and you won't have to care about your the page templates.\n\nBut in case you want to create a page in the old fashion way, with the WordPress editor, you can choose between a few available page templates.\n\n* ###### Default Template\n\n  The default template, with no specific style. The content is centered and takes 750px width for the best readability.\n* ###### Page Full Width\n\n  A template where the content take a larger width that the default one : 1140px.\n* ###### Page with a Left Sidebar\n* ###### Page with a Right Sidebar\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nProtheme comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Protheme, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Protheme also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Protheme you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Protheme.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nProtheme comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Protheme customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Wishlist\n\nProtheme comes with a wishlist feature for WooCommerce.\n\nTo create a \"Wishlist\" page, you must have [Wolf WooCommerce Wishlist](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-woocommerce-wishlist/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is activated, you will get a notice that invites you to create a page for your wishlist. Simply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created with the [wolf\\_wishlist] shortcode inserted.\n\nTo display a Wishlist icon link into your menu, go in the \"Customizer\" > \"Navigation\" tab and check the \"Add Wishlist Menu Item\" option.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Protheme.

Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nTune includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Tune, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=tune).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=tune).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Tune automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Tune is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nTune comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Tune, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Tune.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nTune offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Tune blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Tune.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Tune: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Tune, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Tune using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nTune comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Tune, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Tune also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout.

A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Tune.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Retine theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 2.8.21  \n**Released:** July 21, 2017  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Retine. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **retine.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Retine, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"retine\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Retine theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nRetine includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Retine, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=retine).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=retine).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Retine automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Retine is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nRetine comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Retine, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nRetine offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Retine blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Retine.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Retine: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Retine, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Retine using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nRetine comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Retine, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Retine also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Retine you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Albums\n\nTo create an albums index page, you must have [Wolf Albums](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-albums/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your albums.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Albums\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Albums\" page at any time in the **\"Galleries\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\nThis page will be used by WordPress to display your gallery archives pages: the default gallery index page and the category gallery page.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your albums.\n\n##### Create a gallery for your album\n\nTo create an album, click on \"Galleries\" > \"Add new\".\n\nSet a title for your album, insert a WPBakery Page Builder gallery element in page builder mode, and set a featured image that will be used as album cover.\n\n## Stock Images\n\nRetine comes with custom features to showcase your photos or images, and use your site as a stock images website.\n\nTo use this feature, you must have [Wolf Photos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-photos/wolf-photos.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Create a Stock Photos Archives Page\n\nTo create the main pagefor your stock photos, you must create a page using the \"Stock Photos\" template.\n\nThis page will be used to display the pages for the catgeories, tags, authors, etc...\n\n![](assets/img/photos-template.png)\n\n### Photos\n\n##### Photos Catgories & Tags\n\nWhen you upload a photo, you can choose to assign it to categories or tags. To do that, simply select the photo in the media manager, or in the admin \"Medias\" panel and write your category and tags in the appropriate fields separated by a comma.\n\n#### Only images with a category and/or tags assigned will be displayed in the stock images gallery.\n\nThis way, your logo, backgrounds or other images that you don't want to feature won't be display.\n\n![](assets/img/photo-taxonomy.png)\n\nWhen the photo is open in the \"Attachment details\" or \"Insert Media\" window, the category, tags and custom fields will be updated automatically, so you don't need to hit any \"Save\" button.\n\nSimply separate each categories and tags by a comma and when they will be saved, you will see that they are automatically lowercased and re-order alphabetically.\n\n*If you make a typo when entering your category or tag, it will be saved as new tag or category. That's why it is recommended from time to time to check the \"Media\" > \"Tags\" and \"Media\" > \"Categories\" panels to remove unwanted terms.*\n\n![](assets/img/photo-taxonomy-typo.png)\n\n##### Photos Custom Fields\n\nIn addition to the categories and tags, Retine comes with custom fields for you photo to add additional informations on the single photo page.\n\nYou can choose to add a source and source URL and choose to allow free download for your original photo or add a \"Purchase\" link.\n\nWhen a \"Purchase\" link is set for your photo, you can choose to redirect the single photo page directly to the URL where the photo can be purchased. It means that when the visitor will click on the thumbnail, it will be sent to your desired page instead of the single photo page.\n\nAdditionally, if you use WooCommerc to sell you photo, you can enter the [WooCoomerce ID](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/#section-21) of the product page, so buyers can add the photo directly to their cart from the stock photo gallery.\n\n![](assets/img/photo-custom-fields.png)\n\nBy default, the original, high-resolution uploaded photo won't be accessible at all. Even when the photo is open in the lightbox, that's a web optimized photo that is viewed and not the original one.\n\n##### Add a Watermark to your photo\n\nYou can choose to add a watermark to your photo for example if you want to use Retine to sell your work.\n\nWhen uploading an image, a watermarked and renamed version of the file will be created automatically.\n\nTo add watermark your image, simply check the option in the custom fields on your image editor page.\n\n![](assets/img/photo-watermark-setting.png)\n\nIf your photo has been uploaded before installing Retine, you will have to regenerate your thumbnails using [Force Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/force-regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin.\n\n###### Add your own watermark image\n\nYou can choose your own watermark transparent image in the admin panel > Settings > Watermark.\n\nOnce your watermark image is set, you will have to regenerate your image thumbnails using [Force Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/force-regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin.\n\nYou can choose to regenerate of your photos one by one in the media library panel in list mode.\n\n![](assets/img/single-force-regenerate-thumbnail.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Retine.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nRetine comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Retine customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Wishlist\n\nRetine comes with a wishlist feature for WooCommerce.\n\nTo create a \"Wishlist\" page, you must have [Wolf WooCommerce Wishlist](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-woocommerce-wishlist/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is activated, you will get a notice that invites you to create a page for your wishlist. Simply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created with the [wolf\\_wishlist] shortcode inserted.\n\nTo display a Wishlist icon link into your menu, go in the \"Customizer\" > \"Navigation\" tab and check the \"Add Wishlist Menu Item\" option.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Retine.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Andre theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 2.6.21  \n**Released:** September 13th, 2017  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Andre. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **andre.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Andre, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"andre\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Andre theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nAndre includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Andre, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=andre).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=andre).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Andre automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Andre is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nAndre comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Andre, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nAndre offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Andre blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Andre.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Andre: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Andre, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Andre using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Page templates\n\nIf you use [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wlfthm.es/wpbpb) plugin to create your pages, you will have a lot options to set your page layout and you won't have to care about your the page templates.\n\nBut in case you want to create a page in the old fashion way, with the WordPress editor, you can choose between a few available page templates.\n\n* ###### Default Template\n\n  The default template, with no specific style. The content is centered and takes 750px width for the best readability.\n* ###### Page Full Width\n\n  A template where the content take a larger width that the default one : 1140px.\n* ###### Page with a Left Sidebar\n* ###### Page with a Right Sidebar\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nAndre comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Andre, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Andre also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Andre you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Andre.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nAndre comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Andre customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Andre.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Loud theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 2.6.24  \n**Released:** October 28th, 2017  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Loud. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **loud.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Loud, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"loud\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Loud theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nLoud includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Loud, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=loud).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=loud).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Loud automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Loud is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nLoud comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Loud, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nLoud offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Loud blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Loud.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Loud: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Loud, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Loud using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nLoud comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Loud, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Loud also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Loud you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor.

Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Playlist\n\nHere is a simple video that shows you how to create a playlist with Loud.\n\n### Playlist in Row\n\nTo add a playlist at the bottom of a row, go in the row settings and navigate to the \"Sticky\" player tab.\n\nYou will be able to choose which playlist to display and the skin you want to use fro your player.\n\n![](assets/img/playlist-row.png)\n\n### Playlist Bar a the Bottom of the Page\n\nTo add a sticky player at the bottom of a row, simply use the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/sticky-playlist.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Loud.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nLoud comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Loud customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Wishlist\n\nLoud comes with a wishlist feature for WooCommerce.\n\nTo create a \"Wishlist\" page, you must have [Wolf WooCommerce Wishlist](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-woocommerce-wishlist/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is activated, you will get a notice that invites you to create a page for your wishlist. Simply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created with the [wolf\\_wishlist] shortcode inserted.\n\nTo display a Wishlist icon link into your menu, go in the \"Customizer\" > \"Navigation\" tab and check the \"Add Wishlist Menu Item\" option.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Loud.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Hares theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 2.2.26  \n**Released:** December 14th, 2017  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Hares. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **hares.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Hares, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"hares\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Hares theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nHares includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Hares, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=hares).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=hares).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Hares automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Hares is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nHares comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Hares, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nHares offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Hares blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Hares.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Hares: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Hares, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Hares using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Page templates\n\nIf you use [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wlfthm.es/wpbpb) plugin to create your pages, you will have a lot options to set your page layout and you won't have to care about your the page templates.\n\nBut in case you want to create a page in the old fashion way, with the WordPress editor, you can choose between a few available page templates.\n\n* ###### Default Template\n\n  The default template, with no specific style. The content is centered and takes 750px width for the best readability.\n* ###### Page Full Width\n\n  A template where the content take a larger width that the default one : 1140px.\n* ###### Page with a Left Sidebar\n* ###### Page with a Right Sidebar\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nHares comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Hares, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Hares also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Hares you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## Albums\n\nTo create an albums index page, you must have [Wolf Albums](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-albums/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your albums.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Albums\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Albums\" page at any time in the **\"Galleries\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\nThis page will be used by WordPress to display your gallery archives pages: the default gallery index page and the category gallery page.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your albums.\n\n##### Create a gallery for your album\n\nTo create an album, click on \"Galleries\" > \"Add new\".\n\nSet a title for your album, insert a WPBakery Page Builder gallery element in page builder mode, and set a featured image that will be used as album cover.\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Hares.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nHares comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Hares customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Hares.

Via your FTP client, put the \"glytch\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Glytch theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nGlytch includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Glytch, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=glytch).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=glytch).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Glytch automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Glytch is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nGlytch comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Glytch, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nGlytch offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Glytch blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Glytch.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Glytch: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Glytch, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Glytch using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nGlytch comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Glytch, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Glytch also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Glytch you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Events\n\nTo create an \"Events\" page, you must have [Wolf Events](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-events/wolf-events.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your events.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Events\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Events\" page at any time in the **\"Events\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your events.\n\n##### Add a date to your \"Events\" page\n\nTo add a date to your \"Events\" page, go to **\"Events\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Event Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Playlist\n\nHere is a simple video that shows you how to create a playlist with Glytch.\n\n### Playlist in Row\n\nTo add a playlist at the bottom of a row, go in the row settings and navigate to the \"Sticky\" player tab.\n\nYou will be able to choose which playlist to display and the skin you want to use fro your player.\n\n![](assets/img/playlist-row.png)\n\n### Playlist Bar a the Bottom of the Page\n\nTo add a sticky player at the bottom of a row, simply use the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/sticky-playlist.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Glytch.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nGlytch comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Glytch customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Wishlist\n\nGlytch comes with a wishlist feature for WooCommerce.\n\nTo create a \"Wishlist\" page, you must have [Wolf WooCommerce Wishlist](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-woocommerce-wishlist/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is activated, you will get a notice that invites you to create a page for your wishlist. Simply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created with the [wolf\\_wishlist] shortcode inserted.\n\nTo display a Wishlist icon link into your menu, go in the \"Customizer\" > \"Navigation\" tab and check the \"Add Wishlist Menu Item\" option.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Glytch.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Superflick theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 2.2.21  \n**Released:** March 14th, 2018  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Superflick. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **superflick.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Superflick, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"superflick\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Superflick theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nSuperflick includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Superflick, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=superflick).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=superflick).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Superflick automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Superflick is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nSuperflick comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Superflick, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nSuperflick offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Superflick blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Superflick.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Superflick: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Superflick, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Superflick using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nSuperflick comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Superflick, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Superflick also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Superflick you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Superflick.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nSuperflick comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Superflick customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Wishlist\n\nSuperflick comes with a wishlist feature for WooCommerce.\n\nTo create a \"Wishlist\" page, you must have [Wolf WooCommerce Wishlist](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-woocommerce-wishlist/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is activated, you will get a notice that invites you to create a page for your wishlist. Simply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created with the [wolf\\_wishlist] shortcode inserted.\n\nTo display a Wishlist icon link into your menu, go in the \"Customizer\" > \"Navigation\" tab and check the \"Add Wishlist Menu Item\" option.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Superflick.

If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **phase.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Phase, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"phase\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Phase theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nPhase includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Phase, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=phase).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4.

Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1.

Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=phase).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Phase automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Phase is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nPhase comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Phase, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nPhase offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Phase blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Phase.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Phase: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Phase, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Phase using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nPhase comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Phase, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Phase also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Phase you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Artists\n\nTo create an artists index page, you must have [Wolf Artists](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-artists/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your artists.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Artists\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Artists\" page at any time in the **\"Artists\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\nThis page will be used by WordPress to display your artist archives pages: the default artist index page and the category artist page.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your artists.\n\n##### Link your artists to discography, event, video and gallery categories.\n\nWith Phase, you can create a specific category automatically for every music custom post type (release, event, video etc..) for each artist.

A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Phase.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Zample theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 2.0.25  \n**Released:** June 5th, 2018  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Zample. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **zample.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Zample, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"zample\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Zample theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nZample includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Zample, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=zample).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=zample).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Zample automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Zample is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nZample comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Zample, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Zample.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nZample offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Zample blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Zample.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Zample: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Zample, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Zample using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nZample comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Zample, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Zample also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Zample you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor.

Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Playlist\n\nHere is a simple video that shows you how to create a playlist with Zample.\n\n### Playlist in Row\n\nTo add a playlist at the bottom of a row, go in the row settings and navigate to the \"Sticky\" player tab.\n\nYou will be able to choose which playlist to display and the skin you want to use fro your player.\n\n![](assets/img/playlist-row.png)\n\n### Playlist Bar a the Bottom of the Page\n\nTo add a sticky player at the bottom of a row, simply use the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/sticky-playlist.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nZample comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Zample customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Wishlist\n\nZample comes with a wishlist feature for WooCommerce.\n\nTo create a \"Wishlist\" page, you must have [Wolf WooCommerce Wishlist](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-woocommerce-wishlist/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is activated, you will get a notice that invites you to create a page for your wishlist. Simply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created with the [wolf\\_wishlist] shortcode inserted.\n\nTo display a Wishlist icon link into your menu, go in the \"Customizer\" > \"Navigation\" tab and check the \"Add Wishlist Menu Item\" option.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Zample.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Prequelle theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 2.0.17  \n**Released:** July 1st, 2018  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Prequelle. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **prequelle.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Prequelle, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"prequelle\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Prequelle theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nPrequelle includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Prequelle, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=prequelle).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=prequelle).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Prequelle automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Prequelle is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nPrequelle comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Prequelle, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nPrequelle offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Prequelle blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Prequelle.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Prequelle: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Prequelle, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Prequelle using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Page templates\n\nIf you use [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wlfthm.es/wpbpb) plugin to create your pages, you will have a lot options to set your page layout and you won't have to care about your the page templates.\n\nBut in case you want to create a page in the old fashion way, with the WordPress editor, you can choose between a few available page templates.\n\n* ###### Default Template\n\n  The default template, with no specific style. The content is centered and takes 750px width for the best readability.\n* ###### Page Full Width\n\n  A template where the content take a larger width that the default one : 1140px.\n* ###### Page with a Left Sidebar\n* ###### Page with a Right Sidebar\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nPrequelle comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Prequelle, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Prequelle also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Prequelle you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Prequelle.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nPrequelle comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Prequelle customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Slikk theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.9.25  \n**Released:** August 1st, 2018  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Slikk. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **slikk.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Slikk, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"slikk\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Slikk theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nSlikk includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Slikk, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=slikk).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=slikk).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Slikk automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Slikk is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nSlikk comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Slikk, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nSlikk offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Slikk blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Slikk.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Slikk: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Slikk, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Slikk using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Page templates\n\nIf you use [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wlfthm.es/wpbpb) plugin to create your pages, you will have a lot options to set your page layout and you won't have to care about your the page templates.\n\nBut in case you want to create a page in the old fashion way, with the WordPress editor, you can choose between a few available page templates.\n\n* ###### Default Template\n\n  The default template, with no specific style. The content is centered and takes 750px width for the best readability.\n* ###### Page Full Width\n\n  A template where the content take a larger width that the default one : 1140px.\n* ###### Page with a Left Sidebar\n* ###### Page with a Right Sidebar\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nSlikk comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Slikk, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Slikk also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Slikk you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Slikk.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nSlikk comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Slikk customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Modal Window\n\nSlikk comes with a modal window popup feature to invite visitor to subscribe to your newsletter, send you a mail via a contact form etc.\n\nTo do so, create a [content block](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/12792) and insert any content in it. Then go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Modal Window\"** panel and select which content block to display in your modal window.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Slikk.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Vonzot theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.9.23  \n**Released:** September 8th, 2018  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Vonzot. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **vonzot.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Vonzot, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"vonzot\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Vonzot theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nVonzot includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Vonzot, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=vonzot).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=vonzot).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Vonzot automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Vonzot is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nVonzot comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Vonzot, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nVonzot offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Vonzot blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Vonzot.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Vonzot: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Vonzot, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Vonzot using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Page templates\n\nIf you use [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wlfthm.es/wpbpb) plugin to create your pages, you will have a lot options to set your page layout and you won't have to care about your the page templates.\n\nBut in case you want to create a page in the old fashion way, with the WordPress editor, you can choose between a few available page templates.\n\n* ###### Default Template\n\n  The default template, with no specific style. The content is centered and takes 750px width for the best readability.\n* ###### Page Full Width\n\n  A template where the content take a larger width that the default one : 1140px.\n* ###### Page with a Left Sidebar\n* ###### Page with a Right Sidebar\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nVonzot comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Vonzot, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Vonzot also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Vonzot you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Vonzot.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nVonzot comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Vonzot customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Playlist\n\nHere is a simple video that shows you how to create a playlist with Vonzot.\n\n### Playlist in Row\n\nTo add a playlist at the bottom of a row, go in the row settings and navigate to the \"Sticky\" player tab.\n\nYou will be able to choose which playlist to display and the skin you want to use fro your player.\n\n![](assets/img/playlist-row.png)\n\n### Playlist Bar a the Bottom of the Page\n\nTo add a sticky player at the bottom of a row, simply use the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/sticky-playlist.png)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Vonzot.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Deadlift theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.8.26  \n**Released:** October 12th, 2018  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Deadlift. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **deadlift.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Deadlift, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"deadlift\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Deadlift theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nDeadlift includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Deadlift, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=deadlift).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4.

Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=deadlift).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Deadlift automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Deadlift is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nDeadlift comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Deadlift, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nDeadlift offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Deadlift blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Deadlift.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Deadlift: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Deadlift, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Deadlift using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Page templates\n\nIf you use [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wlfthm.es/wpbpb) plugin to create your pages, you will have a lot options to set your page layout and you won't have to care about your the page templates.\n\nBut in case you want to create a page in the old fashion way, with the WordPress editor, you can choose between a few available page templates.\n\n* ###### Default Template\n\n  The default template, with no specific style. The content is centered and takes 750px width for the best readability.\n* ###### Page Full Width\n\n  A template where the content take a larger width that the default one : 1140px.\n* ###### Page with a Left Sidebar\n* ###### Page with a Right Sidebar\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nDeadlift comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Deadlift, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Deadlift also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Deadlift you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Deadlift.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nDeadlift comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Deadlift customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Wishlist\n\nDeadlift comes with a wishlist feature for WooCommerce.\n\nTo create a \"Wishlist\" page, you must have [Wolf WooCommerce Wishlist](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-woocommerce-wishlist/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is activated, you will get a notice that invites you to create a page for your wishlist. Simply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created with the [wolf\\_wishlist] shortcode inserted.\n\nTo display a Wishlist icon link into your menu, go in the \"Customizer\" > \"Navigation\" tab and check the \"Add Wishlist Menu Item\" option.\n\n## Modal Window\n\nDeadlift comes with a modal window popup feature to invite visitor to subscribe to your newsletter, send you a mail via a contact form etc.\n\nTo do so, create a [content block](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/12792) and insert any content in it. Then go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Modal Window\"** panel and select which content block to display in your modal window.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it!

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Hyperbent theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.9.26  \n**Released:** November 13th, 2018  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Hyperbent. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **hyperbent.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Hyperbent, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"hyperbent\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Hyperbent theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nHyperbent includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Hyperbent, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=hyperbent).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=hyperbent).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Hyperbent automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Hyperbent is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nHyperbent comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Hyperbent, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nHyperbent offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Hyperbent blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Hyperbent.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Hyperbent: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Hyperbent, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Hyperbent using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nHyperbent comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Hyperbent, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Hyperbent also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Hyperbent you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Events\n\nTo create an \"Events\" page, you must have [Wolf Events](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-events/wolf-events.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your events.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Events\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Events\" page at any time in the **\"Events\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your events.\n\n##### Add a date to your \"Events\" page\n\nTo add a date to your \"Events\" page, go to **\"Events\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Event Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Playlist\n\nHere is a simple video that shows you how to create a playlist with Hyperbent.\n\n### Playlist in Row\n\nTo add a playlist at the bottom of a row, go in the row settings and navigate to the \"Sticky\" player tab.\n\nYou will be able to choose which playlist to display and the skin you want to use fro your player.\n\n![](assets/img/playlist-row.png)\n\n### Playlist Bar a the Bottom of the Page\n\nTo add a sticky player at the bottom of a row, simply use the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/sticky-playlist.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Hyperbent.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nHyperbent comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Hyperbent customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Wishlist\n\nHyperbent comes with a wishlist feature for WooCommerce.\n\nTo create a \"Wishlist\" page, you must have [Wolf WooCommerce Wishlist](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-woocommerce-wishlist/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is activated, you will get a notice that invites you to create a page for your wishlist. Simply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created with the [wolf\\_wishlist] shortcode inserted.\n\nTo display a Wishlist icon link into your menu, go in the \"Customizer\" > \"Navigation\" tab and check the \"Add Wishlist Menu Item\" option.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Hyperbent.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Kayo theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.9.18  \n**Released:** December 6th, 2018  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Kayo. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **kayo.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Kayo, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"kayo\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Kayo theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nKayo includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Kayo, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=kayo).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=kayo).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Kayo automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Kayo is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nKayo comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Kayo, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nKayo offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Kayo blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Kayo.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Kayo: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Kayo, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Kayo using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nKayo comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Kayo, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Kayo also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Kayo you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor.

A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Kayo.

If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **reinar.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Reinar, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"reinar\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Reinar theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nReinar includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Reinar, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=reinar).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=reinar).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Reinar automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Reinar is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nReinar comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Reinar, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nReinar offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Reinar blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Reinar.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Reinar: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Reinar, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Reinar using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nReinar comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Reinar, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Reinar also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Reinar you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor.

First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nReinar comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Reinar customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Wishlist\n\nReinar comes with a wishlist feature for WooCommerce.\n\nTo create a \"Wishlist\" page, you must have [Wolf WooCommerce Wishlist](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-woocommerce-wishlist/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is activated, you will get a notice that invites you to create a page for your wishlist. Simply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created with the [wolf\\_wishlist] shortcode inserted.\n\nTo display a Wishlist icon link into your menu, go in the \"Customizer\" > \"Navigation\" tab and check the \"Add Wishlist Menu Item\" option.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Reinar.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Snakepit theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.8.27  \n**Released:** March 6th, 2019  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Snakepit. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **snakepit.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Snakepit, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"snakepit\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Snakepit theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nSnakepit includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Snakepit, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=snakepit).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=snakepit).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Snakepit automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Snakepit is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nSnakepit comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Snakepit, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nSnakepit offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Snakepit blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Snakepit.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Snakepit: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Snakepit, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Snakepit using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nSnakepit comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Snakepit, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Snakepit also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Snakepit you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor.

A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Snakepit.

If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **alceste.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Alceste, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"alceste\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Alceste theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nAlceste includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Alceste, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=alceste).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=alceste).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Alceste automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Alceste is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nAlceste comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Alceste, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nAlceste offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Alceste blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Alceste.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Alceste: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Alceste, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Alceste using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Page templates\n\nIf you use [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wlfthm.es/wpbpb) plugin to create your pages, you will have a lot options to set your page layout and you won't have to care about your the page templates.\n\nBut in case you want to create a page in the old fashion way, with the WordPress editor, you can choose between a few available page templates.\n\n* ###### Default Template\n\n  The default template, with no specific style. The content is centered and takes 750px width for the best readability.\n* ###### Page Full Width\n\n  A template where the content take a larger width that the default one : 1140px.\n* ###### Page with a Left Sidebar\n* ###### Page with a Right Sidebar\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nAlceste comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Alceste, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Alceste also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Alceste you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Alceste.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nAlceste comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Alceste customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Wishlist\n\nAlceste comes with a wishlist feature for WooCommerce.\n\nTo create a \"Wishlist\" page, you must have [Wolf WooCommerce Wishlist](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-woocommerce-wishlist/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is activated, you will get a notice that invites you to create a page for your wishlist. Simply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created with the [wolf\\_wishlist] shortcode inserted.\n\nTo display a Wishlist icon link into your menu, go in the \"Customizer\" > \"Navigation\" tab and check the \"Add Wishlist Menu Item\" option.\n\n## Modal Window\n\nAlceste comes with a modal window popup feature to invite visitor to subscribe to your newsletter, send you a mail via a contact form etc.\n\nTo do so, create a [content block](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/12792) and insert any content in it. Then go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Modal Window\"** panel and select which content block to display in your modal window.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Alceste.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Firemaster theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.8.19  \n**Released:** May 26th, 2019  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Firemaster. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **firemaster.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Firemaster, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"firemaster\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Firemaster theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nFiremaster includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Firemaster, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=firemaster).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=firemaster).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Firemaster automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Firemaster is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nFiremaster comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Firemaster, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nFiremaster offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Firemaster blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Firemaster.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Firemaster: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Firemaster, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Firemaster using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nFiremaster comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Firemaster, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Firemaster also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Firemaster you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor.

A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Firemaster.

Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nMilu includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Milu, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=milu).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=milu).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Milu automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Milu is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nMilu comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Milu, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nMilu offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Milu blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Milu.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Milu: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Milu, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Milu using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Page templates\n\nIf you use [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wlfthm.es/wpbpb) plugin to create your pages, you will have a lot options to set your page layout and you won't have to care about your the page templates.\n\nBut in case you want to create a page in the old fashion way, with the WordPress editor, you can choose between a few available page templates.\n\n* ###### Default Template\n\n  The default template, with no specific style. The content is centered and takes 750px width for the best readability.\n* ###### Page Full Width\n\n  A template where the content take a larger width that the default one : 1140px.\n* ###### Page with a Left Sidebar\n* ###### Page with a Right Sidebar\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nMilu comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Milu, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Milu also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Milu you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Milu.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nMilu comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Milu customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Milu.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Beatit theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 2.6.26  \n**Released:** August 26th, 2019  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Beatit. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **beatit.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Beatit, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"beatit\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Beatit theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nBeatit includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Beatit, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=beatit).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=beatit).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Beatit automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Beatit is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nBeatit comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Beatit, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nBeatit offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Beatit blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Beatit.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Beatit: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Beatit, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Beatit using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nBeatit comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Beatit, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Beatit also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Beatit you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor.

Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Artists\n\nTo create an artists index page, you must have [Wolf Artists](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-artists/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your artists.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Artists\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Artists\" page at any time in the **\"Artists\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\nThis page will be used by WordPress to display your artist archives pages: the default artist index page and the category artist page.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your artists.\n\n##### Link your artists to discography, event, video and gallery categories.\n\nWith Beatit, you can create a specific category automatically for every music custom post type (release, event, video etc..) for each artist. If this option is selected in the **Customizer > Artists** tab, every time you create or update an artist post, it will automatically create or update the coresponding categories.\n\n![](assets/img/artist-sync.png)\n\nThis feature allows the generate tabs in each artist page to display the artist discography, events list, videos and gallery etc...\n\n![](assets/img/artist-tabs.png)\n\nIf a twitter account is set in the **\"Artists Socials\"** option below the text editor, and if the [Wolf Twitter](https://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-twitter/) plugin is installed, an additional tab will be added with the 4 last tweets.\n\n![](assets/img/artist-twitter-tab.png)\n\nIn short, for example with the Discography, if any release is assigned the a specific artist category, it will be automatically displayed in the artist > \"Releases\" tab.\n\n##### Create an artist\n\nTo create an artist post, simply click on \"Artists\" > \"Add new\".\n\nYou can use the main text editor for the \"Biography\" tab and the \"Excerpt\" box for an additional text below the artist's name.

If you want to use the page builder to build your page entirely, you must choose the \"Custom\" layout option in the options below the text editor.\n\nUse the **Artists Options** below your text editor to set a playlist fro your artist and other information about the artist.\n\n## Playlist\n\nHere is a simple video that shows you how to create a playlist with Beatit.\n\n### Playlist in Row\n\nTo add a playlist at the bottom of a row, go in the row settings and navigate to the \"Sticky\" player tab.\n\nYou will be able to choose which playlist to display and the skin you want to use fro your player.\n\n![](assets/img/playlist-row.png)\n\n### Playlist Bar a the Bottom of the Page\n\nTo add a sticky player at the bottom of a row, simply use the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/sticky-playlist.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Beatit.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nBeatit comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Beatit customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Wishlist\n\nBeatit comes with a wishlist feature for WooCommerce.\n\nTo create a \"Wishlist\" page, you must have [Wolf WooCommerce Wishlist](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-woocommerce-wishlist/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is activated, you will get a notice that invites you to create a page for your wishlist.

Then go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Modal Window\"** panel and select which content block to display in your modal window.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Beatit.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Herion theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.8.19  \n**Released:** December 11th, 2019  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Herion. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **herion.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Herion, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"herion\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Herion theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nHerion includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Herion, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=herion).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=herion).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Herion automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Herion is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nHerion comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Herion, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nHerion offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Herion blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Herion.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Herion: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Herion, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Herion using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nHerion comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Herion, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Herion also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Herion you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Artists\n\nTo create an artists index page, you must have [Wolf Artists](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-artists/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your artists.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Artists\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Artists\" page at any time in the **\"Artists\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\nThis page will be used by WordPress to display your artist archives pages: the default artist index page and the category artist page.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your artists.\n\n##### Link your artists to discography, event, video and gallery categories.\n\nWith Herion, you can create a specific category automatically for every music custom post type (release, event, video etc..) for each artist. If this option is selected in the **Customizer > Artists** tab, every time you create or update an artist post, it will automatically create or update the coresponding categories.\n\n![](assets/img/artist-sync.png)\n\nThis feature allows the generate tabs in each artist page to display the artist discography, events list, videos and gallery etc...\n\n![](assets/img/artist-tabs.png)\n\nIf a twitter account is set in the **\"Artists Socials\"** option below the text editor, and if the [Wolf Twitter](https://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-twitter/) plugin is installed, an additional tab will be added with the 4 last tweets.\n\n![](assets/img/artist-twitter-tab.png)\n\nIn short, for example with the Discography, if any release is assigned the a specific artist category, it will be automatically displayed in the artist > \"Releases\" tab.\n\n##### Create an artist\n\nTo create an artist post, simply click on \"Artists\" > \"Add new\".\n\nYou can use the main text editor for the \"Biography\" tab and the \"Excerpt\" box for an additional text below the artist's name.

Then go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Modal Window\"** panel and select which content block to display in your modal window.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Herion.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Staaw theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.6.25  \n**Released:** April 21th, 2020  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Staaw. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **staaw.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Staaw, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"staaw\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Staaw theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nStaaw includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Staaw, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=staaw).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=staaw).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Staaw automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Staaw is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nStaaw comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Staaw, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nStaaw offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Staaw blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Staaw.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Staaw: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Staaw, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Staaw using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Page templates\n\nIf you use [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wlfthm.es/wpbpb) plugin to create your pages, you will have a lot options to set your page layout and you won't have to care about your the page templates.\n\nBut in case you want to create a page in the old fashion way, with the WordPress editor, you can choose between a few available page templates.\n\n* ###### Default Template\n\n  The default template, with no specific style. The content is centered and takes 750px width for the best readability.\n* ###### Page Full Width\n\n  A template where the content take a larger width that the default one : 1140px.\n* ###### Page with a Left Sidebar\n* ###### Page with a Right Sidebar\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nStaaw comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Staaw, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Staaw also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design. We will see that later in this section.\n\nTo use WPBakery Page Builder for your page or post, be sure to click on the **\"Backend Editor\"** button at the top left of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-switcher.png)\n\n\n### Create a Row\n\n![](assets/img/add-element.png)\n\n![](assets/img/row.png)\n\n\nThe \"Row\" is the main WPBakery Page Builder container structure.\n\nEach rows can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, a main Skin Tone - **Light**: dark font for light background or **Dark**: light font for dark background -, and the column layout you want to use.\n\nDepending on the settings you choose, the design of the theme (row padding, margin etc..) will adapt automatically.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow settings example\n\n\n\nBut if you wan to polish the row design even more, you can use the \"Custom\" tab to add your own padding and margin settings and even add your own custom CSS.\n\n**Note: Margin and padding adjustment are widely used in the demo.**\n\n![](assets/img/row-custom-settings-example.png)\n\n\nRow custom settings example\n\n\n\n### Column settings\n\nColumns are the second level container of the row. This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, icon box, custom headings, medias etc...\n\nTo insert an element in your column, click on the \"+\" icon in your column to open the WPBakery Page Builder elements window.\n\n![](assets/img/elements.png)\n\n\n\n### Use WPBakery Page Builder to Display Posts.\n\nIn the WPBakery Page Builder backend editor, click on \"Add Element\" and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/vc-posts-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using WPBakery Page Builder with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using WPBakery Page Builder just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" element , in the WPBakery Page Builder elements window and insert it in your page.\n\n![](assets/img/find-content-block-element.png)\n\n\nFind the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-admin.png)\n\n\nInsert the content block element\n\n\n\n![](assets/img/content-block-frontend.png)\n\n\nThe content block element in the page\n\n\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Staaw you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Staaw.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each WPBakery Page Builder row:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your WPBakery Page Builder row settings.\n\n![](assets/img/section-name.png)\n\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu admin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nStaaw comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Staaw customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Modal Window\n\nStaaw comes with a modal window popup feature to invite visitor to subscribe to your newsletter, send you a mail via a contact form etc.\n\nTo do so, create a [content block](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/12792) and insert any content in it. Then go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Modal Window\"** panel and select which content block to display in your modal window.\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Staaw.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Bronze theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.7.17  \n**Released:** July 9th, 2020  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Bronze. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-wordpress-memory-limit/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/increasing-the-php-max-input-vars/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **bronze.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Bronze, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/system-status/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import).\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"bronze\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Bronze theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Page Builder Extension plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nBronze includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/low-budget-hosts/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Bronze, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/plugin-installations/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=bronze).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server settings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](http://docs.wolfthemes.com/document/server-requirements/)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4.

In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter an error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=bronze).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Bronze automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Bronze is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nBronze comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n3. Display as button (only for first level)\n4. \"Hot\" or \"New\" labels\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n7. Optional Tagline that will be displayed at the top of your mega menu panel\n8. Add an icon near the menu item\n9. Icon position\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Bronze, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. This is very useful if you want to add other menu links that pop up, for example a \"Call to Action\" button.\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate a secondary button menu item\n\n![](assets/img/secondary-menu-button.png)\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n### Create a Custom Home Page Header\n\nBronze offers the possibility to hide the default page header on certain pages using the [header Options](#page-options) below your editor. This way, you can set your own custom page header using [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) or even use [Content Blocks](#content-blocks) to create a custom header for your page.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n#### Full Screen Section\n\nTo create a full screen header section for your home page, insert a WPBakery Page Builder \"Row\" in your page and set the \"Full height\" option in the section setttings.\n\n![](assets/img/row-settings-button.png)\n![](assets/img/row-full-height-setting.png)\n\nSet the background you want for your section and insert any element you want in the row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-bg.png)\n\n#### Home Page Slider\n\nIf you prefer a slider as home page header you can use our **\"Advanced Slider\"** WPBakery Page Builder element or the **\"Revolution Slider\"**.\n\nIn this case, **no need to set your first section to \"Full Height\"**. You will be able to set the slider height in the \"Advanced Slider\" or \"Revolution Slider\" settings.\n\nIf you want your slider to take the full space in your section, select the \"Full Width\" option for your row.\n\n![](assets/img/row-full-width.png)\n\nWe will see more page builder tricks in the [WPBakery Page Builder](#v) section.\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Bronze blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Bronze.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Bronze: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Bronze, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Bronze using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses WPBakery Page Builder, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery WPBakery Page Builder element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## WPBakery Page Builder\n\nBronze comes with a tailored version of WPBakery Page Builder powered by the **Wolf WPBakery Page Builder Extension** .\n\nThis WPBakery Page Builder extension, only available with Bronze, adds many additional elements and comes with a custom admin design.\n\nAdditionaly, Bronze also adds WPBakery Page Builder modules, so you can use WPBakery Page Builder to display your posts integrated in the theme design.

This is where you will insert your different elements. Just like rows, columns come with many settings to create advanced layout. For each column you can set a different background, color tone etc...\n\n![](assets/img/column-settings.png)\n\n\n#### You can check a few examples of what it's possible to do with the Row & Columns system on [this demo page](https://demos.wolfthemes.com/protheme/features/columns/).\n\n### Elements\n\nThe WPBakery Page Builder elements are the actual content that you can insert in your page.

It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"General tab\"**.\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-blocks.png)\n\n\nContent block customizer Options\n\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [WPBakery Page Builder](#visual-composer) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor.

Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Bronze.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Swingster theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.4.23  \n**Released:** June 8th, 2021  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Swingster. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **swingster.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Swingster, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"swingster\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Swingster theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nSwingster includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Swingster, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=swingster).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=swingster).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Swingster automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Swingster is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nSwingster comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Swingster, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Swingster blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Swingster.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Swingster: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Swingster, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Swingster using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Swingster you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Events\n\nTo create an \"Events\" page, you must have [Wolf Events](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-events/wolf-events.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your events.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Events\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Events\" page at any time in the **\"Events\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your events.\n\n##### Add a date to your \"Events\" page\n\nTo add a date to your \"Events\" page, go to **\"Events\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Event Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your event page.\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Swingster.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nSwingster comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Swingster customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Swingster.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Speaker theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 2.4.21  \n**Released:** May 7th, 2014  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Speaker. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **speaker.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Speaker, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"speaker\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Speaker theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nSpeaker includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Speaker, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=speaker).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=speaker).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Speaker automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Speaker is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nSpeaker comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Speaker, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Speaker blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Speaker.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Speaker: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Speaker, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Speaker using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Speaker you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Events\n\nTo create an \"Events\" page, you must have [Wolf Events](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-events/wolf-events.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your events.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Events\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Events\" page at any time in the **\"Events\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your events.\n\n##### Add a date to your \"Events\" page\n\nTo add a date to your \"Events\" page, go to **\"Events\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Event Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your event page.\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Speaker.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nSpeaker comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Speaker customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Speaker.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Nu theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.5.19  \n**Released:** August 1th, 2021  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Nu. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **nu.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Nu, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"nu\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Nu theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nNu includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Nu, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=nu).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=nu).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Nu automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Nu is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nNu comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Nu, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Nu blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Nu.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Nu: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Nu, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Nu using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Elementor\n\nNu comes with a tailored version of Elementor powered by the **Wolf Core Extension** .\n\nThis Elementor extension, only available with Nu, adds many additional elements.\n\nAdditionaly, Nu also adds Elementor post module widgets, so you can use Elementor to display your posts integrated in the theme design.\n\nTo use Elementor for your page or post, first create and save your page or post, then click on the **\"Build with Elementor\"** button at the top of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-button.png)\n\n\n### Create a Container\n\nThe \"Container\" is the main Elementor container structure.\n\nEach container can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, the column layout you want to use, and many other options, like the padding and margin..\n\nYou can also insert inner containers.\n\nTo get started, drop any widget in the page.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-widget-drop.png)\n\n\nYou will most likely need to got in the \"advanced\" tab and set a top and bottom padding for your section.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-padding.png)\n\n\n### Widgets\n\nThe Elementor widgets are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, custom headings, medias etc.\n\nTo insert an element in your column, as we saw above, simply drop your widget in the page.\n\nAdditional widgets, only available via Nu, can be found in the \"Extension\" widget section.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-extension-widgets.png)\n\n\n\n### Use Elementor to Display Posts.\n\nIn the Elementor backend editor, go in the \"Post Modules\" section of your widgets and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-post-modules.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-post-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using Elementor with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with Elementor on your website, please follow the steps to troubleshoot and resolve\ncommon problems in the post belos\n\n<https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/20209/>\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Nu you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Nu.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nNu comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Nu customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n## Brush stroke video entrance animation\n\nIf you want to use the brush animation entrance on a certain page check the option in your page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/brush-vid-entrance.png)\n\n## Heading\n\nNu comes with an improved heading widget. To give your headings more life across your website, you can check some of the additional options.\n\n### Animate on scroll\n\nWith Elementor, you can add a widget animation on scroll by going in the \"Advanced\" tab > Motion effects settings of your widget.\nBut we added a quick option in the main heading settings area to add a custom animation option.\n\n### Theme formatting\n\nYou can use this option to vary fonts and text styles in your heading. If you check this option, use em, b and u HTML tags to make your desired words pop out\n\nYou can set the font used for the em and b (or strong) tag in the customizer > font tab.\n\nExample:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `My <``em``>awesome</``em``> title with <``b``>bold</``b``> and <``u``>underline</``u``> text` |\n\n![](assets/img/nu-heading-theme-fromatting.png)\n\n## Demo Content\n\nIf you chose to import the demo content to help you to get started, please be aware that we use the \"Query\" tab > \"Include post IDs\" to vary the work post order among the different demo pages.\n\nBe sure to remove remove this setting if you want to display your post in the regular order.\n\n\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Nu.

If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **spectacle.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Spectacle, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"spectacle\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Spectacle theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nSpectacle includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Spectacle, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=spectacle).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=spectacle).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Spectacle automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Spectacle is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nSpectacle comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Spectacle, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Spectacle blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Spectacle.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Spectacle: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Spectacle, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Spectacle using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Spectacle you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Events\n\nTo create an \"Events\" page, you must have [Wolf Events](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-events/wolf-events.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your events.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Events\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Events\" page at any time in the **\"Events\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your events.\n\n##### Add a date to your \"Events\" page\n\nTo add a date to your \"Events\" page, go to **\"Events\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Event Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your event page.\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Spectacle.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nSpectacle comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Spectacle customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it!

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Effigy theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.4.17  \n**Released:** February 23th, 2022  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Effigy. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **effigy.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Effigy, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"effigy\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Effigy theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nEffigy includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Effigy, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=effigy).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=effigy).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Effigy automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Effigy is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nEffigy comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Effigy, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Effigy blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Effigy.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Effigy: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Effigy, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Effigy using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Effigy you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Events\n\nTo create an \"Events\" page, you must have [Wolf Events](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-events/wolf-events.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your events.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Events\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Events\" page at any time in the **\"Events\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your events.\n\n##### Add a date to your \"Events\" page\n\nTo add a date to your \"Events\" page, go to **\"Events\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Event Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your event page.\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Effigy.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nEffigy comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Effigy customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Effigy.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Omnity theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.3.27  \n**Released:** April 20th, 2022  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Omnity. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **omnity.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Omnity, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"omnity\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Omnity theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nOmnity includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Omnity, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=omnity).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=omnity).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Omnity automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Omnity is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nOmnity comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Omnity, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Omnity blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Omnity.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Omnity: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Omnity, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Omnity using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Omnity you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Omnity.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nOmnity comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Omnity customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Omnity.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Elsass theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.3.21  \n**Released:** June 6th, 2022  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Elsass. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **elsass.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Elsass, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"elsass\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Elsass theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nElsass includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Elsass, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=elsass).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=elsass).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Elsass automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Elsass is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nElsass comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Elsass, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Elsass blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Elsass.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Elsass: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Elsass, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Elsass using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Elsass you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Events\n\nTo create an \"Events\" page, you must have [Wolf Events](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-events/wolf-events.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your events.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Events\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Events\" page at any time in the **\"Events\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your events.\n\n##### Add a date to your \"Events\" page\n\nTo add a date to your \"Events\" page, go to **\"Events\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Event Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your event page.\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Elsass.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nElsass comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Elsass customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Elsass.

If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **overable.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Overable, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"overable\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Overable theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nOverable includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Overable, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=overable).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4.

Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=overable).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Overable automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Overable is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nOverable comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Overable, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Overable blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Overable.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Overable: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Overable, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Overable using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Overable you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n\n\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Overable.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nOverable comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Overable customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Overable.

It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Morvan, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=morvan).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=morvan).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Morvan automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Morvan is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nMorvan comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Morvan, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Morvan blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Morvan.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Morvan: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Morvan, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Morvan using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Morvan you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Morvan.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nMorvan comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Morvan customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Clix theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.1.27  \n**Released:** August 17th, 2023  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Clix. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **clix.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Clix, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"clix\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Clix theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nClix includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Clix, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=clix).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=clix).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Clix automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Clix is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nClix comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Clix, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Clix blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Clix.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Clix: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Clix, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Clix using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Clix you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Clix.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nClix comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Clix customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Clix.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Gaintab theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.1.27  \n**Released:** October 11th, 2023  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Gaintab. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **gainlab.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Gaintab, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"gainlab\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Gaintab theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nGaintab includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Gaintab, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=gainlab).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=gainlab).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Gaintab automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Gaintab is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nGaintab comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Gaintab, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Gaintab blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Gaintab.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Gaintab: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Gaintab, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Gaintab using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Gaintab you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Gaintab.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nGaintab comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Gaintab customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Gaintab.

If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4.

Once you activate Unimate, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"unimate\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Unimate theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nUnimate includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Unimate, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=unimate).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=unimate).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Unimate automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Unimate is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nUnimate comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Unimate, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Events\n\nTo create an \"Events\" page, you must have [Wolf Events](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-events/wolf-events.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your events.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Events\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Events\" page at any time in the **\"Events\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your events.\n\n##### Add a date to your \"Events\" page\n\nTo add a date to your \"Events\" page, go to **\"Events\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Event Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your event page.\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor.

It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Unimate.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Unimate: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Unimate, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Unimate using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Unimate you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Unimate.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nUnimate comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Unimate customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Unimate.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Notescape theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.1.21  \n**Released:** March 21th, 2024  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Notescape. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **notescape.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Notescape, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"notescape\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Notescape theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nNotescape includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Notescape, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=notescape).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=notescape).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Notescape automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Notescape is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nNotescape comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Notescape, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Notescape blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Notescape.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Notescape: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Notescape, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Notescape using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Notescape you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Discography\n\nTo create a \"Discography\" page, you must have [Wolf Discography](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-discography/wolf-discography.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your discography.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Discography\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Discography\" page at any time in the **\"Discography\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your releases.\n\n##### Add a release to your \"Discography\" page\n\nTo add a release to your \"Discography\" page, go to **\"Discography\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n## Events\n\nTo create an \"Events\" page, you must have [Wolf Events](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-events/wolf-events.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your events.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Events\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Events\" page at any time in the **\"Events\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your events.\n\n##### Add a date to your \"Events\" page\n\nTo add a date to your \"Events\" page, go to **\"Events\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Event Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your event page.\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Notescape.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nNotescape comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Notescape customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Typography\n\nIf you want to use the elipse or underline animation entrance, you can use the `elipse` and `underline` within the Heading or Text Block widget.\n\nExample:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `My <``elipse``>awesome</``elipse``> title with <``underline``>underline</``underline``> text` |\n\nYou can also add a distorted text effect by using the `distorted` tag.\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `My <``distorted``>awesome</``distorted``> text` |\n\n## Text Entrance Animation\n\nNotescape comes with a text animation option for the **Heading** and **Text**.\n\nYou can select the \"Appears on scroll\" option in the main \"Content\" tab of these widgets.\n\n![](assets/img/text-entrance.png)\n\n## Scroll Animation\n\nThe **Container** widget comes with a \"Scroll Effect\" setting to add a parallax or \"on scroll\" effect to your element.\n\nFor the **Container** widget, you can find this setting in the \"Content\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/scroll-animation.png)\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Notescape.

If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **eightpulse.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate EightPulse, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"eightpulse\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate EightPulse theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nEightPulse includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In EightPulse, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=eightpulse).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1.

Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=eightpulse).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update EightPulse automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of EightPulse is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nEightPulse comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith EightPulse, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe EightPulse blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in EightPulse.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in EightPulse: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith EightPulse, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to EightPulse using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith EightPulse you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## Videos\n\nTo create a \"Videos\" page, you must have [Wolf Videos](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-videos/wolf-videos.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your Videos.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the Videos page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Videos\" page at any time in the **\"Videos\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your videos.\n\n##### Add a video to your \"Videos\" page\n\nTo add a video to your \"Videos\" page, go to **\"Videos\" > \"Add New\"** and paste a YouTube or a Vimeo URL in the text editor.\n\nWordPress will automatically turn it to a video.\n\n**You must set a \"Featured Image\" for each video**.\n\nWith Wolf Videos plugin, you can generate a video thumbnail automatically by clicking on **\"Generate thumbnail\"** link in the \"Video Thumbnail\" box just above your \"Featured Image\" box, at the right of your text editor.\n\n## Events\n\nTo create an \"Events\" page, you must have [Wolf Events](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-events/wolf-events.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your events.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Events\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Events\" page at any time in the **\"Events\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your events.\n\n##### Add a date to your \"Events\" page\n\nTo add a date to your \"Events\" page, go to **\"Events\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Event Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your event page.\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with EightPulse.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nEightPulse comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the EightPulse customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Typography\n\nIf you want to use the accent color, you can use the `accent` tag within the Heading or Text Block widget.\n\nExample:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `My <``accent``>awesome</``accent``> title` |\n\nYou can also use the custom font that comes with the theme by adding the \"under-station\" class:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `My <``accent` `class``=``\"under-station\"``>awesome</``accent``> title.` |\n\n## Text Entrance Animation\n\nEightPulse comes with a text animation option for the **Heading** and **Text**.\n\nYou can select the \"Appears on scroll\" option in the main \"Content\" tab of these widgets.\n\n![](assets/img/text-entrance.png)\n\n## Scroll Animation\n\nThe **Container** widget comes with a \"Scroll Effect\" setting to add a parallax or \"on scroll\" effect to your element.\n\nFor the **Container** widget, you can find this setting in the \"Content\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/scroll-animation.png)\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin.

For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that.

    "content": "# Thank You!\n\n##### Thanks a lot for purchasing Yor theme.\n\nIf you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file,  \nplease browse our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n**Version:** 1.0.22  \n**Released:** July 26th, 2024  \n**By**: [WolfThemes](http://wolfthemes.com)\n\n## WordPress Installation\n\nA working and up-to-date version of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) must be installed before you can install Yor. If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **yor.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Yor, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"yor\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Yor theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nYor includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Yor, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=yor).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=yor).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Yor automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Yor is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nYor comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Yor, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Yor blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Yor.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Yor: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Yor, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Yor using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Yor you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## Albums\n\nTo create an albums index page, you must have [Wolf Albums](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-albums/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your albums.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Albums\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Albums\" page at any time in the **\"Galleries\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\nThis page will be used by WordPress to display your gallery archives pages: the default gallery index page and the category gallery page.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your albums.\n\n##### Create a gallery for your album\n\nTo create an album, click on \"Galleries\" > \"Add new\".\n\nSet a title for your album, insert a Elementor gallery element in page builder mode, and set a featured image that will be used as album cover.\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Yor.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nYor comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Yor customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Typography\n\nIf you want to use the accent color, you can use the `accent` tag within the Heading or Text Block widget.\n\nExample:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `My <``accent``>awesome</``accent``> title` |\n\nYou can also use the custom font that comes with the theme by adding the \"under-station\" class:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `My <``accent` `class``=``\"under-station\"``>awesome</``accent``> title.` |\n\n## Text Entrance Animation\n\nYor comes with a text animation option for the **Heading** and **Text**.\n\nYou can select the \"Appears on scroll\" option in the main \"Content\" tab of these widgets.\n\n![](assets/img/text-entrance.png)\n\n## Scroll Animation\n\nThe **Container** widget comes with a \"Scroll Effect\" setting to add a parallax or \"on scroll\" effect to your element.\n\nFor the **Container** widget, you can find this setting in the \"Content\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/scroll-animation.png)\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Yor.

If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4. Choose the **\"Upload\"** option and upload the **poize.zip** file.\n5. Once you activate Poize, you will be redirected to the \"Welcome\" page that features a [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654/) table.  \n   There you will see a button to **install and activate the required & recommended plugins**. If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"poize\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate Poize theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nPoize includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In Poize, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=poize).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4. Hit the \"Import\" button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/customizer-import.png)\n\n\nImport customizer.dat file\n\n#### Import the widgets\n\nTo import the widget settings you need [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin.\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Tools\" > \"Widget Export & Import\"**\n2. Select the **widgets.wie file**\n3. Hit the **\"Import\"** button\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/import-widgets.png)\n\n\nImport widgets.wie file\n\nPlease note that recently, the widget import plugin has stopped woking since recent WP updates, so if you encounter\nan error notice, you can safely ignore this step.\n\n## Import Revolution Sliders\n\nFirst download the demo data files [here](https://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=poize).\n\nYou will find the demo sliders in the **\"revslider\"** folder.\n\nTo import a slider, navigate to your admin **Slider Revolution panel**, click on the \"Import Slider\" icon and select your chosen slider zip file from the \"revslider\" folder.\n\n![import slider](assets/img/import-slider.png)\n\n## Theme Update\n\nTo update Poize automatically, you can install [Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market).\n\nYou will be invited to install and activate this plugin on theme activation, so it is recommended to install it if you want to update the theme automatically.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, simply go in the Envato Market admin panel and follow the instructions to connect your Envato account.\n\n**You will get notified in your admin dashboard every time a new version of Poize is available. Simply follow the link in the notification message and update the theme is a single click in the Envato maket plugin page.**\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/update-theme.png)\n\n\nUpdate the theme\n\n### Important note\n\n[Envato Market plugin](https://github.com/envato/wp-envato-market) is a 3rd party plugin developed by the Envato team and we have no control over its development.\n\nUsers have reported issues we this plugin recently. In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nPoize comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith Poize, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe Poize blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in Poize.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in Poize: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith Poize, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to Poize using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Elementor\n\nPoize comes with a tailored version of Elementor powered by the **Wolf Core Extension** .\n\nThis Elementor extension, only available with Poize, adds many additional elements.\n\nAdditionaly, Poize also adds Elementor post module widgets, so you can use Elementor to display your posts integrated in the theme design.\n\nTo use Elementor for your page or post, first create and save your page or post, then click on the **\"Build with Elementor\"** button at the top of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-button.png)\n\n\n### Create a Container\n\nThe \"Container\" is the main Elementor container structure.\n\nEach container can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, the column layout you want to use, and many other options, like the padding and margin..\n\nYou can also insert inner containers.\n\nTo get started, drop any widget in the page.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-widget-drop.png)\n\n\nYou will most likely need to got in the \"advanced\" tab and set a top and bottom padding for your section.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-padding.png)\n\n\n### Widgets\n\nThe Elementor widgets are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, custom headings, medias etc.\n\nTo insert an element in your column, as we saw above, simply drop your widget in the page.\n\nAdditional widgets, only available via Poize, can be found in the \"Extension\" widget section.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-extension-widgets.png)\n\n\n\n### Use Elementor to Display Posts.\n\nIn the Elementor backend editor, go in the \"Post Modules\" section of your widgets and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-post-modules.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-post-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using Elementor with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with Elementor on your website, please follow the steps to troubleshoot and resolve\ncommon problems in the post belos\n\n<https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/20209/>\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith Poize you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Artists\n\nTo create an artists index page, you must have [Wolf Artists](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-artists/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your artists.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Artists\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Artists\" page at any time in the **\"Artists\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\nThis page will be used by WordPress to display your artist archives pages: the default artist index page and the category artist page.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your artists.\n\n##### Link your artists to discography, event, video and gallery categories.\n\nWith Poize, you can create a specific category automatically for every music custom post type if available (release, event, video etc..) for each artist. If this option is selected in the **Customizer > Artists** tab, every time you create or update an artist post, it will automatically create or update the coresponding categories.\n\n![](assets/img/artist-sync.png)\n\n##### Create an artist\n\nTo create an artist post, simply click on \"Artists\" > \"Add new\".\n\nYou can use the main text editor for the \"Biography\" tab and the \"Excerpt\" box for an additional text below the artist's name. If you use the page builder for the bio, it is recommended to set your row \"Content Width\" to \"Full Width\". If you want to use the page builder to build your page entirely, you must choose the \"Custom\" layout option in the options below the text editor.\n\nUse the **Artists Options** below your text editor to set a playlist fro your artist and other information about the artist.\n\n## Events\n\nTo create an \"Events\" page, you must have [Wolf Events](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-events/wolf-events.zip) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your events.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Events\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Events\" page at any time in the **\"Events\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your events.\n\n##### Add a date to your \"Events\" page\n\nTo add a date to your \"Events\" page, go to **\"Events\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Event Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your event page.\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor. Additionally, you can insert any content to display on your release page.\n\n### Work Options\n\nOn work post type, below your text editor, you will find several option for your current work single page.\n\n![](assets/img/work-options.png)\n\n## One-Page Website\n\nIt is super simple to create a \"One-Page\" website with Poize.\n\nTo create a one-page website there is 2 things you have to do for each Elementor section:\n\n1. First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nPoize comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the Poize customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin. It is ultra light and ultra simple to use.\n\nOnce the plugins installed, while you're working on your website, go in the admin > Tools >\"Maintenance\" panel and choose the page where you want to redirect all your visitors. For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that. Now all error pages will display the content of this page.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nCommon issues with links to fix them:\n\n* [Stylsheet is missing](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11682/)\n* [Error importing demo content](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11680/)\n* [Menu items not saving](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11675/)\n* [404 error page](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11681/)\n\nMore ressources:\n\n[FAQ](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11678/) | [Knowledge Base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/)\n\n##### Thanks again for purchasing Poize.

If you need help installing WordPress, follow the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), or check our [knowledge base](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/articles/).\n\n## Server Requirements\n\n### Consideration\n\nMost of the issues users may experience are related to [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not respected.\n\nIssues you may encounter, such as demo content importing fails, menu partially not saving, page not rendered correctly and other oddity are related to excessively low PHP configuration limit settings of the server.\n\nMany hosts will try to keep the limits low to save their resources. These values are typically lower if you choose a [low budget host](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\n### System Status\n\nBefore starting, right after installing the theme, check your [System Status](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11654).\n\nThe most important values you need to be compliant are:\n\n* **WP Memory Limit**: the WP Memory Limit is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that your site can use at one time. When you reach your Memory Limit, you’ll encounter a fatal error. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11676/))\n* **Max Input Vars**: the PHP Max Input Vars is the maximum number of variables your server can use. Lower values can create issues such lost data in your Theme Options, Widgets disappear etc. ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com//article/11675/))\n\n## Installation\n\n### WordPress Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on ThemeForest.\n2. In your WordPress admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"**.\n3. Select the **\"Install Theme\"** tab at the top panel.\n4.

If you see any red message about the [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651/) not fulfilled please fix.\n6. You must install all the required plugins if you want to [import the demo data](#import)\\*.\n7. **If you want to import the demo data, it is recommended to decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicate content.**\n\n*Users have reported issues installing the plugins using the bulk installation. In case you ecnounter any issue, please install each plugin one by one by clicking on the \"install\" link below each plugin in the list.*\n\n### FTP Installation\n\n1. **Extract the archive** package downloaded on Themeforest.\n2. Via your FTP client, put the \"mediafoundry\" folder in `wp-content/themes/`.\n3. Once the upload is complete you can activate MediaFoundry theme.\n4. Follow the instructions from the paragraph above starting at point 5.\n\n**Save some time and use our custom installation services.**\n\n[Get Installation Services](http://wolfthemes.com/services)\n\n### Activate Wolf Core plugin\n\nOnce the theme and plugins are installed you need to activate the **Wolf Core** plugin to unlock all features.\n\nTo do so, go into the **Appearance** > **About the Theme** panel and click on the \"**License**\" tab.\n\nSimply enter your [theme purchase code](http://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202822600-Where-Can-I-Find-my-Purchase-Code-) to activate the plugin.\n\n## One-Click Demo Import\n\nMediaFoundry includes a 3rd party plugin ([One-Click Demo Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-demo-import/)), to allow you to import the demo content easily. It is the most used plugin for this purpose.\n\n### IMPORTANT: Before attempting to import the demo content, as mentionned in the [\"Before Getting Started\"](#beforestart) section, be sure that your server fulfills the minimum [Server Requirements](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651).\n\nSuccessfully importing the data into WordPress is not something we can guaranty at 100% for all users. There are a lot of variables that come into play, over which we have no control. Most of the time, the main issues are [bad shared hosting servers](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/).\n\nAfter installing and activating the theme, you will have a \"blank\" version of the theme with the defaults options and mods.\n\nImporting the demo data is the easiest way to setup your theme. It will allow you to quickly edit everything instead of creating content from scratch. In MediaFoundry, you can install the whole demo content through the \"Import Demo Data\" panel.\n\nFirst of all, you must install all the [required plugins](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11655/) after theme activation. You may be invited to install default plugin pages. **You must decline all plugin page installations to avoid duplicated content**. Once all your plugins are installed, go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Import Demo Data\"** panel, choose your chosen demo and click the \"Import\" button and wait, it can take a few minutes.\n\n![Import Plugin message](assets/img/install-plugins-button.png)\n\n*Note that, as the demo content is in English, the **Site Language must be set to \"English (United States)\" in the \"Settings\" > \"General\" panel** . You will be able to chage it afterwards.*\n\n![](assets/img/import-demo.png)\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\nIf you any issue importing the demo content using the \"One-Click demo Import\" plugin, please check the [plugin troubleshooting documentation.](https://github.com/proteusthemes/one-click-demo-import/blob/master/docs/import-problems.md)\n\n## Import Demo Content Manually\n\nFirst, download the demo data files [here](http://updates.wolfthemes.com/download.php?theme=mediafoundry).\n\nUpload the zip folder and extract it using an archiver (winrar, winzip etc..). You will find 3 files and a folder in the archive.\n\n1. **content.xml** - The file containing all pages, medias etc...\n2. **customizer.dat** - The customizer settings\n3. **widgets.wie** - The widgets settings\n\n#### Import the content\n\nAfter testing several alternatives to the default WordPress importer, we found that the [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\nworks fine even for hosts with [low server\nsettings](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11668/). To use this plugin instead of the default importer plugin,\ndeactivate \"WordPress Importer\" and install and activate this one instead.\n\nSo first, install and activate [WordPress-Importer v2](http://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer) plugin\n\nBe sure that the default WordPress importer plugin is deactivated if you have install it previously.\n\n[![download-wordpress-importer-v2](assets/img/download-wordpress-importer-v2.png)](https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer)\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to \"Tools\" > \"Import\"\n2. Choose the WordPress V2 option (last one)\n3. Select the content.xml file\n4. Hit the \"upload file and import\" button and follow the instructions\n\n**After importing the demo content, go in Elementor > tools and hit the \"Regenerate CSS files\" button.**\n\n![Run WP Importer](assets/img/run-wp-importer.png)\n\n\nInstall WordPress Importer\n\n\n![Upload via WP Importer](assets/img/import-xml.png)\n\n\nUpload content.xml file\n\n*Note that some of our demo data files are huge and you may encounter issues if your server settings are too low, especially max\\_execution\\_time, post\\_max\\_size,  and upload\\_max\\_filesize settings ([read more](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11651)).*\n\n#### Import the customizer settings\n\nOn theme activation, all Customizer Mods are automatically set just like the demo. Still, you can reset them or upload a different set of Customizer Mods using [Customizer Export/Import plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/).\n\n1. In your admin panel, go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Customize\"** or click on the \"Customize\" link in your frontend admin bar\n2. Navigate to the **\"Export/Import\" tab**\n3. Click the \"browse\" button and select the **customizer.dat** file\n4.

In waiting for this to be resolved, you can update the theme manually.\n\n* Go to your [ThemeForest download section](https://themeforest.net/downloads) and re-upload the theme as you did when you purchased it.\n* Navigate to your admin **\"Appearance\" > \"Themes\"** panel\n* Desinstall the theme\n* Re-install the new theme version\n\n**You won't lose any of your content or settings by updating the theme this way.**\n\n## Main menu\n\nThe main menu is the main navigation that will be displayed at the top of your site.\n\n### Desktop Menu\n\nBy default, no menu is set up when activating the theme if you didn't import the demo content with the \"One-Click Demo Import\" feature. In this case, you must create the menu yourself in the \"**Apearance**\" > \"**Menu**\" WordPress panel.\n\n![install WP Importer](assets/img/primary-menu.png)\n\n\nCreate your *Primary Menu*\n\nBe sure to assign your menu to the \"Primary Menu\" location.\n\n#### Dropdown Menu Item\n\nTo create a dropdown menu item and be sure that it won't be linked when clicking on it on touchable devices, create a custom links and set a \"#\" as URL.\n\n![](assets/img/dropdown.png)\n\n### Menu Items Options\n\nMediaFoundry comes with custom options for your menu items.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-item-options.png)\n\n1. Display all menu item children in mega menu\n2. Check if it's a 2nd level mega menu item or a standard drop down item\n3. Hide the item if it's a mega menu 2nd level item\n4. \"Hot\", \"New\", or \"Sale\" labels will be added to the menu item\n5. Smooth Scroll to anchor (for example to create a [One-Page Site](#onepage))\n6. Menu Columns\n\n### Mega Menu\n\n**A mega menu must have 3 levels**.\n\n1. The first level is the main parent menu item\n2. The second level is mandatory and must be set to display 3rd level items in a column.\n   It will be used as column title or you can choose to hide it with the checkbox option 2 (see above)\n3. The 3rd level menu items\n\n![](assets/img/mega-menu-structure.png)\n![](assets/img/mega-menu.png)\n\n### Additional Menu Area\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta.png)\n\nWith MediaFoundry, you can choose to add content in your menu, for example icons linked to your social network profiles or shop menu items if [WooCommerce](#woocommerce) is installed. To choose which type of content you want to add, go at the bottom of the Customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-options.png)\n\n*Please note that like many other customizer options, it can be overwritten for each page, in the page options, below your text editor.*\n\n#### Add a Secondary Menu\n\nIf you choose the \"Secondary Menu\" option, create a new menu and assign it as \"Secondary Menu\" in the menu location panel. You will be able to use this menu in the additional menu area.\n\n#### Add Social Icons\n\nIf you choose the \"Socials\" options, you must enter the list of social services you want to display in the field below.\n\nBe sure to fill your desired social services in the \"**Customizer**\" > \"**Socials**\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-cta-socials.png)\n\n*Note: after importing the demo content, as the main menu contains a lot of menu items, manipulating the menu tabs\ncan seems laggy. That's why we recommend createing your own menu to include only the pages you need on your\nwebsite.*\n\n### Mobile Menu\n\nTo display the mobile menu, the theme will use your primary menu. There is no need to create a new specific menu.\n\nYou can set below each window width point you want to display the mobile version of the main menu in the WordPress customizer \"Navigation\" tab.\n\n![](assets/img/menu-breakpoint.png)\n\n### Side Panel\n\nYou can choose to add a \"Side Panel\" to your menu.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel-option.png)\n\nThis is a widget area that can be open from the main menu and that will be available only in the desktop menu.\n\nTo add widgets to this area, simply nivigate to the \"Widgets\" tab of your customizer or go in the admin \"Appearance\" > \"Widgets\" panel.\n\n![](assets/img/side-panel.png)\n\n## Header Options\n\n*First note that these options are available if you use the default header. This is not relevant you use a [content block](#cotnent-blocks) as header (if the theme supports content blocks).*\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your header for each post in the \"**Header Options**\" below the main text editor.\n\nThis will overwrite the \"Header Layout\" settings from the [Customizer](#customizer).\n\n1. By default, the featured image will be used as header background. If no featured image is set, the header image from the customizer header tab will be used (if set). If no featured image and no default header image is found, the header background will be a simple solid default color.\n   ![](assets/img/header-featured-image.png)\n2. If you want a different header image than your featured, simply choose the \"Image\" option in the dropdown field.\n   ![](assets/img/header-custom-bg.png)\n3. You can also choose a video or a slideshow as header background. In this case, simply set the desired option and fill the fields below accordingly.\n   ![](assets/img/header-slideshow.png)\n\nFor even more flexibility, if you want to replace the in-built header, you can choose to hide the header completely and use a [Content Block](#content-blocks).\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n## Home\n\nTo set a page as \"Front page\", go in the **\"WordPress Settings\" > \"Reading\"** panel and set the desired page as **\"Front page\"**.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\n## Blog\n\nBy default, when no pages are set in the WordPress \"Settings\" > \"Reading\" panel, your last posts will be displayed on your front page.\n\nBut here, we want to set a specific page for our blog.\n\nTo do so, create a page with no content and assign it as \"Posts page\" in the \"reading\" settings.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/reading.png)\n\nThis particular page will used to display the blog archives, categories, tags etc...\n\n### Post formats\n\nThe MediaFoundry blog supports all WordPress post formats.\nPost Formats allow you to display your posts differently depending on your content.\nIn you post editor page, you can select which post format you want to use in the \"Format\" box, usually, at the right of your text editor.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/formats-box.png)\n\n#### Standard\n\nIt is the typical WordPress post. It will display the title, the featured image (if set) and the content below.\n\n#### Image\n\nA single image. The featured image will be used, and, on click, will open its full size version in a lightbox.\n\n#### Gallery\n\nThe theme will look for the first gallery in your post content and use it as featured gallery.\n\nAny gallery or slider will be considered as gallery.\n\n#### Video\n\nThe first video URL will be considered the video.\n\nYou can use our [Wolf Video Thumbnail Generator](http://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator/wolf-video-thumbnail-generator.zip) plugin to generate a thumbnail from any Vimeo or YouTube video automatically and use it as featured image. The script will look for the first YouTube or Vimeo URL in your post and generate a thumbnail. You should find the “Video Thumbnail” metabox above the “Featured Image” box.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/themes/aku/assets/img/video-thumbnail.png)\n\n#### Audio\n\nAn audio file. You can use the audio shortcode provided by WordPress using the media library (\"Add media\" button).\nYou can also embed a soundloud song using WordPress embed feature by pasting your song soundcloud URL.\n\n#### Link\n\nA link to another site. The first URL in your post will be used and your post title will be linked to this URL.\n\n#### Quote\n\nThe first quote of your post will be considered as the featured quote.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/quote.png)\n\n#### Status\n\nTypically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.\nYou can use this post pormat to display an embed tweet.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/embed-tweet.jpg)\n\n#### Aside\n\nSame as status format\n\n#### Chat\n\nA chat transcript, like so:\n\n```\nJohn: foo\nMary: bar\nJohn: foo 2\n```\n\nThere isn't any specific style for the chat post format in MediaFoundry.\n\n### Split your post\n\n*Firs, note that the more tag won't be used if you choose the \"Auto excerpt\" option in the customizer \"Blog\" tab or with certain blog layout.*\n\nYou can split your post to add a \"Continue reading →\" link on the post index page.\n\nTo do so, use the WordPress [more tag](http://en.support.WordPress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/).\n\nYou can find the More Tag button in the first row of the visual editor\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/more-button.png)\n\n\nYou can further customize the message that displays in the link to the full post content.\n  \nYou will need to do this in the HTML view of your editor. Once you have changed to the HTML editor, look for this code:\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more-->` |\n\nTo customize the message, simply add a space after\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more` |\n\nand turn it into something like this…\n\n[?](#)\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| `<!--more But wait, there is more!-->` |\n\n### Single Post Options\n\nYou can choose how you want to display your post single view in the [Post Options](#settings), just below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/post-options.png)\n\n\n*Note that the \"Featured\" options will be used for the metro layout, to display a bigger post thumbnail for your post.*\n\n## Theme Settings\n\nTheme settings are the backbone of the theme. They give you full control over your website and allow you to customize the design without modifying a single line of code. There is three type of options you can set in MediaFoundry: the **Customizer Mods**, the **Single Page Options** and the other Admin \"Appeareance\" sub-menus available depending on the plugins installed.\n\n### Customizer Mods\n\nThe Customizer Mods are responsible for the global appearance of the entire website, unless otherwise specified in Page Options. They are accessible in the **“Appearance” > “Customizer”** from your admin panel, or directly by clicking on **“Customize”** in the frontend admin bar.\n\n### Page Options\n\nThe Page Options are located inside every page, post, product (or other post type). You can override particular Customizer Mods for single page diversification.\n\nMost of these settings will be available for all post types.\n\n![](assets/img/page-options.png)\n\n\nAdditionaly, specific options will be available depending on the post type.\n\n### Elementor Page Settings\n\nSome of the most useful page options can also be found directly via the Elementor panel\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-page-settings.png)\n\n\n### Other Options\n\nIn addition to the Customizer mods and Page Options, you will find other custom options in the \"Appearance\" sub menus.\n\nFor example the [Font Loader](#fonts).\n\n## Google Fonts\n\nWith MediaFoundry, you can load any Google font you like and use it for your menu, headings, text etc...\n\nTo load Google Fonts:\n\n1. Go to the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website and select the fonts you like.\n2. Open the \"Families Selected\" frame at bottom right of your screen.\n3. Copy the fonts list from the last part of the URL right after \"?family=\"\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/google-fonts.png)\n4. Go to the **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\"** panel and paste your fonts list.\n\n   ![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/theme-options-fonts.png)\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Google fonts anywhere in the theme where a “fonts” option is available.\n\n## Typekit Fonts\n\nYou can also add any Typekit fonts to MediaFoundry using [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/).\n\n1. Install and activate [Typypekit Fonts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/typekit-fonts-for-wordpress/) plugin.\n2. Go to **\"Settings\" > \"Typekit Fonts\"** and follow the instructions to import your font kit into your website.\n3. Go to **\"Appearance\" > \"Font Loader\" tab** add your fonts separated by a \"|\" (i.e \"Adobe Caslon Pro|Acumin Pro\").\n\nNow, you will be able to select your Typekit fonts anywhere in the theme where a “font” option is available.\n\n## Basics\n\n### Set a featured image\n\nA post featured image is an image that you can upload to represent your post, page or other post type.\n\nSet a featured image is very simple: In your text editor, click on \"set a featured image\" (usually the box at the bottom right), upload an image and click on \"use as featured image\" instead of \"insert into post\".\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/featured-image.png)\n\n### Create a gallery\n\n**Note that for a theme that uses Elementor, it is even simpler to insert an image gallery Elementor element.**\n\nTo create a gallery in your post or page, first click on the \"Add media\" button at the top of your text editor.\n\nWhen you open the Media Manager, you will be shown the files in your Media Library. If you’d like to create a gallery from those files, then you’re already where you need to be. Just click on \"Create a gallery\" on the left menu and select the files you’d like to include in your gallery.\nYou can re-order you image as you wish, upload new files, add captions to your images etc...\n\n### WordPress embed\n\nThis WordPress feature allows you to display a media by simply paste its URL in your post.\n\nFor exemple, simply paste a youtube video URL into your post. WordPress will automatically turn that into a YouTube embed.\n\nLearn more infos on the [WordPress Codex page.](http://codex.WordPress.org/Embeds)\n\n## Elementor\n\nMediaFoundry comes with a tailored version of Elementor powered by the **Wolf Core Extension** .\n\nThis Elementor extension, only available with MediaFoundry, adds many additional elements.\n\nAdditionaly, MediaFoundry also adds Elementor post module widgets, so you can use Elementor to display your posts integrated in the theme design.\n\nFirst, **ensure that Elementor’s default styles are not interfering with your theme** by disabling the default colors and fonts.\nHere’s how:\n\n* Go to Elementor > Settings > General tab.\n* Check the boxes for Disable Default Colors and Disable Default Fonts.\n* This will allow your theme’s styles to load correctly without being overridden by Elementor’s defaults.\n\n**Also, double check that the relevant post types are enabled.**\n\n![](https://ticksy_attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5300443649.png)\n\n\nTo use Elementor for your page or post, first create and save your page or post, then click on the **\"Build with Elementor\"** button at the top of your WordPress text editor to switch to Page Builder mode.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-button.png)\n\n\n### Create a Container\n\nThe \"Container\" is the main Elementor container structure.\n\nEach container can be displayed differently: you can choose a background, the column layout you want to use, and many other options, like the padding and margin..\n\nYou can also insert inner containers.\n\nTo get started, drop any widget in the page.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-widget-drop.png)\n\n\nYou will most likely need to got in the \"advanced\" tab and set a top and bottom padding for your section.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-padding.png)\n\n\n### Widgets\n\nThe Elementor widgets are the actual content that you can insert in your page. It includes, text blocks, custom headings, medias etc.\n\nTo insert an element in your column, as we saw above, simply drop your widget in the page.\n\nAdditional widgets, only available via MediaFoundry, can be found in the \"Extension\" widget section.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-extension-widgets.png)\n\n\n\n### Use Elementor to Display Posts.\n\nIn the Elementor backend editor, go in the \"Post Modules\" section of your widgets and choose the \"Posts\", \"Works\", \"Products\" elements or any other available post type.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-post-modules.png)\n\n\nYou will be able to choose the layout and styling options for your post module.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-post-settings.png)\n\n\n### Create a \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page\n\nTo create a page to use as \"Maintenance\" or \"Coming Soon\" page, create a page using Elementor with the elements you want to display (count down, newsletter subscribe form etc...) and use the [Page Options](#page-options) below your text editor to hide the in-built header, footer and menu.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\nOnce you're done, [switch your website to maintenance mode](#maintenance).\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with Elementor on your website, please follow the steps to troubleshoot and resolve\ncommon problems in the post belos\n\n<https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/20209/>\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nThe \"Content blocks\" feature is an amazing system to create content that you can use as page fragments, or custom header and footer.\n\nSimply create a content block (**\"Content Block\"** > **\"Add New\"**) using Elementor just like a regular page and use it anywhere you want in different pages.\n\n![](assets/img/add-new-content-block.png)\n\n\nCreate a content block\n\n\n\nTo add a Content Block in your page, find the \"Content Block\" widget , in the Elementor widgets window and drop it into your page.\n\n### Post-Header & Pre-Footer\n\nWith MediaFoundry you can set content blocks as post-header and/or pre-footer area. It will display your choosen Content Block, just below the header, and/or just before the footer.\n\nYou can set you header and footer blocks to be displayed on all pages via the **\"Customizer\" > \"Layout\" tab**.\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-content-block-layout.png)\n\n\nIf you want to use a content block to replace the header, be sure to disable the default header in the Customizer > Header tab (set the layout to \"**No Header**\").\n\n![](assets/img/customizer-disable-header.png)\n\n\nOr you can set your custom header and footer blocks only on certain pages using the page options below your text editor.\n\n![](assets/img/blocks-options.png)\n\n\nContent block page Options\n\n\n\nNote that the content block option includes an inheritance system. For example, if you set a particular header block on your blog page (the page set as page for posts in the WordPress reading settings), all blog pages will inherit this setting.\n\nOf course, you can use this feature to replace the in-built header or footer, by hiding the footer or header using the page options. This way you can, for example, create a custom footer for several pages and use the in-built footer on every other pages.\n\n![](assets/img/no-header.png)\n\n\n![](assets/img/no-footer.png)\n\n## Artists\n\nTo create an artists index page, you must have [Wolf Artists](http//wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-artists/) plugin installed.\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your artists.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Artists\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Artists\" page at any time in the **\"Artists\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\nThis page will be used by WordPress to display your artist archives pages: the default artist index page and the category artist page.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create any page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your artists.\n\n##### Link your artists to discography, event, video and gallery categories.\n\nWith MediaFoundry, you can create a specific category automatically for every music custom post type if available (release, event, video etc..) for each artist. If this option is selected in the **Customizer > Artists** tab, every time you create or update an artist post, it will automatically create or update the coresponding categories.\n\n![](assets/img/artist-sync.png)\n\n##### Create an artist\n\nTo create an artist post, simply click on \"Artists\" > \"Add new\".\n\nYou can use the main text editor for the \"Biography\" tab and the \"Excerpt\" box for an additional text below the artist's name. If you use the page builder for the bio, it is recommended to set your row \"Content Width\" to \"Full Width\". If you want to use the page builder to build your page entirely, you must choose the \"Custom\" layout option in the options below the text editor.\n\nUse the **Artists Options** below your text editor to set a playlist fro your artist and other information about the artist.\n\n## Portfolio\n\nTo create a \"Portfolio\" page, you must have [Wolf Portfolio](https://plugins.wolfthemes.com/wolf-portfolio/wolf-portfolio.zip) plugin installed.\n\n### Set your Portfolio Archives Page\n\nOnce the plugin is installed and activated, you will see a notification in your dashboard inviting you to create a page for your portfolio.\n\nSimply click on the **\"Create Page\"** button and a page will be automatically created and assigned for the \"Portfolio\" page.\n\nYou can change the page you want to use as \"Portfolio\" page at any time in the **\"Portfolio\" > \"Settings\"** panel.\n\n*Note that any content in this page will be ignored.*\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also create another page and use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your works.\n\n### Add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page\n\nTo add a work to your \"Portfolio\" page, go to **\"Portfolio\" > \"Add New\"** and fill the \"Release Details\" box below the text editor.

First set a unique section name in your Elementor section settings.\n\n![](assets/img/elementor-section-name.png)\n\n\n*Since recent versions of Elementor that use the container system instead of sections, the \"Name\" attribute can be found in the \"Advanced\" tab of your container settings*\n\n![container name](assets/img/elementor-container-name.png)\n\n2. Set the \"One-Page Navigation\" option to \"Yes\" on the \"Page Options\" below your text editor.\n\n![one page menu](assets/img/one-page-menu-option.png)\n\nA one-page menu will be automatically generated based on your sections and replace the default menu.\n\nBe sure to create a default mobile menu and assign it to the \"mobile\" menu location in the menu\nadmin panel, to make\nthe\none-page mobile menu functioning.\n\n## WooCommerce\n\nMediaFoundry comes with WooCommerce integration, which allows you to build your online shop.\n\nIf WooCommerce is activated you will find a \"Shop\" tab in the MediaFoundry customizer options. You can set your number of products per page and your shop layout there.\n\nYou can also use [Elementor](#elementor) to display your products wherever you want.\n\nYou can check the complete WooCommerce documentation here:\n\n<http://docs.woothemes.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/>\n\n## Child Theme\n\nAll our theme packages include a child theme. A WordPress child theme allows you to apply custom code changes to your site. Using a child theme ensures your customizations will not be overwritten, even if you update the parent theme.\n\nFor most cases, you won’t need a child theme if you just want to add a couple of lines of CSS for a style adjustment. You can add custom CSS styles directly in the Customizer \"Additional CSS\" tab (since WordPress 4.7.2). But if you need more advanced customizations, like more CSS rules to overwrite the styles of the theme or even add your own PHP functions, it is strongly recommended to use a child theme.\n\n### How to set up your own Child Theme\n\nAlthough child themes can be a great way to add custom changes to your theme, they are most often used to customize core code taken from the parent theme. Because of this, please be aware that customizations of this nature fall outside our scope of support, and we will be unable to assist you with any issues that may arise. To use the child theme, find the “themename-child” folder in your theme package and upload it to your `wp-content/themes` folder through FTP. As it is mainly made to be edited, we didn’t include it as a zip file, so you will have to install it manually. Once installed and activated, it will automatically inherit all parent theme features, functions, and styles.\n\n### Additional Ressources\n\n[WordPress Codex on Child Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)\n[How To Create A WP Child Theme video by WPBeginner.com](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/how-to-create-a-wordpress-child-theme-video/)\n\n## Maintenance Mode\n\nTo switch your website in maintenance mode you can download [Wolf Maintenance](http://wolfthemes.com/plugin/wolf-maintenance/) plugin.

For example a coming soon page.\n\n![](https://assets.wolfthemes.com/documentation/images/maintenance.jpg)\n\nWhen your website is ready to go, simply set the options to \"Disabled\" to put your whole website back online.\n\n## Custom 404 Page\n\nTo set a custom 404 error page you must install and activate [404page – your smart custom 404 error page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/404page/) plugin.\n\nFirst, create the page that you want to use as 404 page.\n\nThen, simply navigate to **\"Appearance\" > \"404 Error Page\"** panel in your WordPress admin and set the page you just created as your \"Page to be displayed as 404 page\" in the plugin settings.\n\nThat's it! Simple as that.
