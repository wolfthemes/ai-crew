Hi there,

To update WPBakery to version 8.3.1, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Latest Version**: Whenever a plugin is updated, you can find the latest version of WPBakery in the `config/plugins` (or `includes/admin/plugins`) folder of your theme.

2. **Deactivate & Delete the Old Plugin**:
   - Go to your WordPress Dashboard.
   - Navigate to **Plugins**.
   - Find WPBakery Page Builder, click on **Deactivate**, and then **Delete** it.

3. **Reinstall the New Version**:
   - After deletion, go to **Appearance** > **Install Plugins**.
   - Here you can find the option to install the new version of WPBakery.

Please keep in mind that after a new version is released, we need a few days to test compatibility with our themes. If you encounter any issues or need further guidance, feel free to check the detailed instructions in our knowledge base article here: [WolfThemes Article](https://wolfthemes.ticksy.com/article/11671/).

I hope it helps!

Best regards,
